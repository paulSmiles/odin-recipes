    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>All be honest, going into this with recipe testing I was 
        thinking it would more so be a recipe the kids would love – but it turns out that equally as well adults 
        will absolutely love this French bread pizza too!</p>
    <p>But of course that only makes sense because it’s layered with so much goodness and it’s extra cheesy!

        It has incredible flavor, perfect texture (crisp exterior, soft interior) and it’s so easy to customize (see below for ideas, or just think of your favorite creative pizza and make that here!).
        
        Not only is it a great after school snack, but it is definitely something I would proudly serve to guests on the weekend (just pair it with a simple salad topped with Spaghetti Factory copycat creamy pesto dressing).
        
        It’s just so tasty! Especially if you go the easy homemade pizza sauce route.
        
        Who doesn’t love a recipe that’s this simple, that can taste this good??</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>French bread: Use soft crusted french bread from the store that’s wrapped in plastic wrap, not paper. Not only is it easier to cut but if you bake dry crust again it will become cardboard-like.
             I like to use one that is a day old so it’s a 
             little sturdier and it doesn’t end up soggy.</li>
        <li>Pizza sauce: I highly recommend my homemade pizza sauce for this. It will only
             add a few more minutes prep, worth it!</li>
    </ul>
